# Dog quiz game!

> Collaborative final project for 23 Code Street

## The idea:

A game/quiz to help make learning to code a little more fun!

## The game:

Help Dug collect bones from the field. After 30 seconds you'll be given a code-related quiz question.

- Get it right? Continue to play!
- Get it wrong? It's game over - add yourself to the leaderboard.
- **How many bones can you collect before the timer runs out?**

- make some note about how we thought about accessibility
